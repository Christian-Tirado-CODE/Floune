# Floune


## Fundamentals

E-commerce built using React.js and Firebase. The purpose of this project was to learn React fundamentals(Components(class-based/functional), state, HTTP Requests, Routing, Redux, authentication, animations, Hooks).

## Real Time Help Chat(Sockets.io)
Users can ask help from admin and get live answers. This is my favorite feature of the app :)

## Online Payments(Stripe.js)
